# Work with linting and unit testing

Code quality can be assessed in two ways: linting and unit testing. Use linting to check for any stylistic errors and unit testing to verify your functions.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't, complete the [set-up](00-set-up.md) before you continue.

You'll also need the GitHub Action that triggers the Azure Machine Learning pipeline created in Challenge 3. 

## Learning objectives

By completing this challenge, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a development and production environment.
- Add environments to GitHub Action.
- Add a required reviewer to the staging job environment.

## Tasks

In the **tests** folder, you'll find files that will perform linting and unit testing on your code. 

- Within your GitHub repo, create a development and production environment. 
- 

## Success criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to show:

- A successfully completed Action in your GitHub repo that includes linting and unit testing.
